## Color Coding for Easy Parsing

To enhance readability and comprehension, the document employs a strategic color-coding system. This system aids students in quickly identifying and differentiating between factors, operators, and other mathematical elements. The color theme is as follows:

- **Pastel Hunter Green**: Represents the primary factor or coefficient.
- **Pastel Orange**: Represents the secondary factor or coefficient.
- **Pastel Maroon**: Denotes mathematical operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.
- **Pastel Dark Purple**: Used for alternate terms or results.

The use of colors not only makes the document visually appealing but also facilitates faster parsing and understanding of algebraic rules.

## Credits
